# Autosmooth-Menu 1-8 (untill blender 2.83)

* I did some code corrections to simplify the code 
* I added a little white little button appearing when show xray is on . you can drag on it (left right) to set the alpha or double click to enter a value (for some reason the code is not the same on 2.9 to set the xray alpha so I will do an update later for 2.9)
